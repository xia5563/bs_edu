BS education demo site

Hi there,

This is a online repository for demo website "BS education" created by Chao Xia. I built only the front end of the website without any back end. 

The technologies I've used include: Html, Scss, Jquery, Bootstrap, and gulp. I didn't upload the gulp folder "node_modules" because it's just a folder for gulp plugins and can be too large and slow to upload. However, I uploaded the file "package.json" and "gulpfile.js" so you can see what gulp plugins I've used and how I compile html, compress js and css. The "src" folder contains all the source code I've written while the "dist" folder has all the files compiled, compressed, and ready for production environment. You can detach the "dist" folder from other folders and use it independently because it contains everything needed for running the website. However, if you intend to see or change my source code, you can detach the "src" folder, change it and compile it yourself. If you need some help, please let me know via: chaoxia.bsedu@gmail.com
